# FIPPERD Award Nomination Generator Requirements
# This application uses only Python standard library modules
# No additional packages required for basic functionality

# The following are the standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - json (settings persistence)
# - os (file operations)

# For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# For CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install tkinter
# For macOS: tkinter is included with Python
# For Windows: tkinter is included with Python

# No pip install required - this application uses only standard library modules!
